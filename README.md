Terminal Tetris is a Python-based reimagining of the classic arcade game, designed to run entirely within the terminal.

The game uses the [Rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) library to enhance the interface with colorful emoji blocks and live score tracking. It also utilizes [Blessed](https://pypi.org/project/blessed/) for handling keypresses and terminal behavior, and [Prompt Toolkit](https://python-prompt-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/master/) to manage input for features like the leaderboard.

Despite the absence of a graphical window, the game remains engaging, responsive, and faithful to the spirit of the original.

---

### Game Interface

- The game board is drawn entirely in the terminal using colored emoji blocks (e.g., üü•, üü¶) for a vibrant and engaging experience.
- The layout is designed to render correctly on **Heroku‚Äôs terminal emulator**, even with its limited emoji/font support.
- The game detects the operating system and terminal type:
  - **If running locally** (on Windows or macOS with full emoji support), emoji blocks like üü• are used.
  - **If running on Heroku**, it falls back to alternative block characters (e.g., `‚ñì`) to ensure full compatibility.
- Tetrominoes fall from the top of the board and can be moved or rotated using the arrow keys.
- Real-time rendering is handled with `blessed`, keeping the experience smooth and responsive.

## Flowchart

The following flowchart represents the core logic of the Terminal Tetris application, from initial launch to game over and score submission.

It illustrates how the game interacts with user input (movement, rotation, quit), score updates, row clearing, and end-game options like restarting or submitting to the leaderboard.

## Class Design: `Piece` and `MaxLengthValidator`

### `Piece` Class (in `piece.py`)

The `Piece` class represents a falling Tetris piece (Tetromino). It encapsulates all logic related to its shape, position, and rotation:

- `shape_name`: The identifier for the piece type (e.g. "T", "L", etc.).
- `shape`: A 2D list representing the block layout.
- `emoji`: The character used to draw the piece (emoji or block, depending on terminal compatibility).
- `row`, `col`: The current position of the piece on the board.

#### Key Method Highlights:

- **`get_coords()`**  
  Calculates and returns the piece‚Äôs occupied positions on the board.

- **`rotate(board)`**  
  Attempts to rotate the piece clockwise. The rotation is only applied if it doesn‚Äôt result in a collision or out-of-bounds error.

- The class is used alongside a helper function `new_random_piece()` to spawn a new piece with a random shape and emoji color.

---

### `MaxLengthValidator` Class (in `game_logic.py`)

This class inherits from `prompt_toolkit.validation.Validator` and ensures that leaderboard names are no longer than 10 characters.

- It checks the input string length and raises a `ValidationError` if the limit is exceeded.
- This class enhances user experience by providing immediate and styled feedback within the terminal input field.

## Architecture & Module Justification

The project follows a modular architecture, where each Python file handles a specific responsibility. This separation ensures maintainability, clarity, and alignment with OOP and clean code principles.

### Module Overview

- **`run.py`**  
  The main entry point of the program. It calls the welcome screen and then starts the game loop. This keeps startup logic clean and isolated from the gameplay code.

- **`game_logic.py`**  
  This is the central hub of the gameplay. It manages the core loop, user inputs, piece updates, rendering coordination, and game state transitions (e.g., game over, restarting, saving scores).  
  It also includes the `MaxLengthValidator` class for limiting leaderboard name input.

- **`piece.py`**  
  Contains the `Piece` class, which models each Tetromino's position, shape, rotation, and appearance.  
  Includes `new_random_piece()` to spawn a random piece using data from the `constants` module.

- **`board.py`**  
  Manages the game board ‚Äî a 2D grid of cells. Provides functions to:
  - Check valid movement (`can_move`)
  - Lock pieces to the board (`lock_piece`)
  - Render temporary positions (`add_piece_to_board`)
  - Animate and clear completed lines (`clear_lines`)

- **`user_interface.py`**  
  Handles all terminal output using `rich` and `blessed`. This includes:
  - The welcome screen
  - Drawing the game board and next piece
  - Creating side panels for score and controls
  It keeps all visual logic separated from game logic.

- **`highscores.py`**  
  Manages all leaderboard functionality via `gspread` and Google Sheets:
  - Fetches and formats high scores (single or dual-column display)
  - Submits a new score when a user enters their name after the game
  All spreadsheet access and formatting are neatly encapsulated in this file.

- **`constants.py`**  
  Centralizes all constants and configuration:
  - Board dimensions and game speed
  - Tetromino shapes and block styles
  - Emoji vs fallback blocks (adjusted via `IS_HEROKU` environment variable)
  - Valid input keys for gameplay
  This file helps make the game configurable and Heroku-compatible without cluttering logic files.

---

This structure allows each module to focus on a single task:

- **Gameplay logic** stays in `game_logic.py`.
- **UI rendering** is managed entirely by `user_interface.py`.
- **Board and piece management** are abstracted into `board.py` and `piece.py`.
- **Persistent data (scores)** is handled in `highscores.py`.

This not only improves clarity and testability but also makes the project scalable ‚Äî for example, adding a new piece type, UI enhancement, or leaderboard feature can be done without disrupting the entire codebase.

Overall, the architecture supports a clean development workflow, real-time terminal gameplay, and deployability to cloud platforms like Heroku.


## Technologies Used

## Future Features

- **Pause & Resume**: Add the ability to pause gameplay and resume mid-session.
- **Custom Key Bindings**: Let users remap controls to suit their preferences.
- **Ending**: Tetris famously includes an "End", but this version goes on without a set endpoint.
- **Position in Leaderboard**: When the game is over, the user is shown where they rank in all scores.
- **Animated Title Screen**: Make the welcome screen more dynamic using Rich's animation features.


## Bugs

### Solved Bugs

1. **Heroku Compatibility with Emoji Rendering**
   - **Issue:** Emoji blocks (üü•, üü¶, etc.) rendered incorrectly in the Heroku terminal.
   - **Solution:** Used `os.name` and platform detection to switch to simpler characters (like `‚ñì`) when running on Heroku.

2. **Username Input Too Long**
   - **Issue:** Users could enter more than 10 characters for leaderboard names.
   - **Solution:** Input is now programmatically truncated to 10 characters. A visual warning informs users of the limit.

3. **Duplicate Game Over Trigger**
   - **Issue:** The game over logic was firing more than once, causing visual or logical glitches in score submission.
   - **Solution:** Added a safeguard to ensure the game over sequence can only be triggered once per session.

4. **Unintended Key ("4") Was Speeding Up the Piece**
   - **Issue:** Pressing certain number keys (e.g., "4") unintentionally triggered downward movement.
   - **Solution:** Implemented a strict `VALID_KEYS` check to ignore all unintended input and only respond to defined arrow keys.

5. **Leaderboard Input Misalignment**
   - **Issue:** User input for the leaderboard was not well-aligned or styled on different terminal sizes.
   - **Solution:** Replaced basic input with `prompt_toolkit` for consistent, styled, and center-aligned user prompts.

### Unsolved Bugs

- **Piece movement speeds up when holding left or right**
  - **Issue:** Holding the left or right arrow key increases the falling speed of the current piece, similar to holding the down arrow.
  - **Reason for not fixing:** This behavior is due to how key events are handled in the terminal. Fixing it would require complex asynchronous input tracking or threading, which is not justified for the scope of this project. It doesn't break the game and is minor in gameplay impact.
