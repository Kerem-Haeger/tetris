Terminal Tetris is a Python-based reimagining of the classic arcade game, designed to run entirely within the terminal.

The game uses the [Rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) library to enhance the interface with colorful emoji blocks and live score tracking. It also utilizes [Blessed](https://pypi.org/project/blessed/) for handling keypresses and terminal behavior, and [Prompt Toolkit](https://python-prompt-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/master/) to manage input for features like the leaderboard.

Despite the absence of a graphical window, the game remains engaging, responsive, and faithful to the spirit of the original.

### Game Interface

- The game board is drawn entirely in the terminal using colored emoji blocks (e.g., üü•, üü¶) for a vibrant and engaging experience.
- The layout is designed to render correctly on **Heroku‚Äôs terminal emulator**, even with its limited emoji/font support.
- The game detects the operating system and terminal type:
  - **If running locally** (on Windows or macOS with full emoji support), emoji blocks like üü• are used.
  - **If running on Heroku**, it falls back to alternative block characters (e.g., `‚ñì`) to ensure full compatibility.
- Tetrominoes fall from the top of the board and can be moved or rotated using the arrow keys.
- Real-time rendering is handled with `blessed`, keeping the experience smooth and responsive.
